                <p>Add commitment and determination to your goals and you will find that you are willing <br>to take continuous and consistent action toward making your dreams a reality, despite any obstacles in your path,<br>including difficult times.

Having goals and staying committed to them will keep your focus on the things that you have identified as essential<br> to reaching your desired outcomes.  Too often, we expend precious time on issues that have nothing<br>
to do with what we really want in our lives. We get distracted by focusing on what others are doing and achieving,<br> and striving to do the same.

Having a vision and a supporting plan of what you want to achieve in life<br> is necessary if you ever want to arrive at the correct destination.</p>

          <p>Success does not have a definite definition as it varies from one person to another.<br>
          Success could be simply defined as the satisfaction a person gets by achieving his or her goal.<br>
          Success does not come without any problems as the road to success is filled with many hurdles.<br>
          To achieve success one needs to be determined in life and have a plan to accomplish that goal.  
Success is directly proportional<br>
to the amount of hard work and the time you have invested in achieving that goal. Hard work here to work physically<br>
which makes you tired but it just means that you have to prioritize important things that will make you successful<br>
and work towards it. Failure is the most important step in achieving your goals. Many of us fear as we think that it<br>
will not make us successful but sometimes failing is important as it helps in determining your path. Imagine what would<br>
have happened if Thomas Edison hesitated while he worked on discovering light? the world would have still been dark.<br>
Donâ€™t fear failure, face it as it will help in achieving success.</p>
