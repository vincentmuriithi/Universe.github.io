                <P>Dancing has been a culture for quite a long time now and would remain as so for <strong>a long time</strong>
                <br>
                Dancing is our universal body language that we use for expression despite the lyrics of our favourite music.<br>
                Some believe ancing is a talent but it's also true to say that anyone can be taught to dance.<br>
                To dance you  have to be flexible,swift and giving out your energy in a superb way.
                </P>
