              A Lovely Love Story
              by Edward Monkton  
            </h1>
            <p>The fierce Dinosaur was trapped inside his cage of ice. Although it was cold he was happy in there. It was, after all, HIS cage.

<br>Then along came the Lovely Other Dinosaur.<br>

The Lovely Other Dinosaur melted the Dinosaur’s cage with kind words and loving thoughts.<br>

I like this Dinosaur, thought the Lovely Other Dinosaur. Although he is fierce he is also tender and he is funny. He is also quite clever though I will not tell him this for now.

<br>I like this Lovely Other Dinosaur, thought the Dinosaur. She is beautiful and she is different and she smells so nice. She is also a free spirit, which is a quality I much admire in a dinosaur.

<br>But he can be so distant and so peculiar at times, thought the Lovely Other Dinosaur<br>

He is also overly fond of Things. Are all Dinosaurs so overly fond of Things?<br>

But her mind skips from here to there so quickly, thought the Dinosaur. She is also uncommonly keen on Shopping. Are all Lovely Other Dinosaurs so uncommonly keen on shopping?

<br>I will forgive his peculiarity and his concern for Things, thought the Lovely Other Dinosaur. For they are part of what makes him a richly charactered individual.

<br>I will forgive her skipping mind and her fondness for shopping, thought the Dinosaur. For she fills our life with beautiful thought and wonderful surprises. Besides, I am not unkeen on shopping either.

<br>Now the Dinosaur and the Lovely Other Dinosaur are old. Look at them.

<br>Together they stand on the hill telling each other stories and feeling the warmth of the sun on their backs.<br>

And that, my friends, is how it is with love. Let us all be Dinosaurs and Lovely Other Dinosaurs together.<br>

For the sun is warm. And the world is a beautiful place…</p>
